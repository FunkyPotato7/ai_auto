{"sessionId":"86c2uwrtz","rewritten_description":"Okay, here's a rewritten version of the content, focusing on clarity and ease of understanding:\n\n**PROBLEM:**\n\nThe current collection settings only allow filtering products based on stock availability in a very limited way. We can't use multiple tags within the same collection while also filtering by stock. This restricts our ability to create highly specific and targeted collections.\n\n**SOLUTION:**\n\nWe need a way to filter products by \"in-stock\" status directly within the theme customizer. This would give us more flexibility in managing collections.\n\n*   **Option 1 (Preferred):** Implement an \"In Stock Only\" filter option directly in the theme customizer.\n*   **Option 2 (Alternative):** If adding to the customizer is too complex, implement the \"In Stock Only\" filter directly in the theme's code.\n\n**TESTING:**\n\nTo verify the solution:\n\n1.  Remove any existing \"in stock\" filtering conditions from the collection's current parameters (wherever they are currently defined).\n2.  Browse the collection on the storefront.\n3.  Confirm that the collection **does not** display any out-of-stock products. This ensures the new \"In Stock Only\" filter is working correctly.\n","data":{"id":"86c2uwrtz","custom_id":null,"custom_item_id":0,"name":"Filter In stock collection directly form the customizer","text_content":"WHY IS THIS TICKET NEEDED?\nCurrently, we can only filter by stock availability from the collection settings, which does not allow us to add multiple tags within the same collection.
